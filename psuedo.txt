create 3 variables for rock, paper, and scissors
rock = 1
paper = 2
scissors = 3
Get Computer Choice:
create a function that will generate a computer Choice: (getComputerChoice)
    assign random number between 1 and 3 to variable 'choice'
    create return variable named cpuChoice
    If choice == 1 return cpuChoice = rock
    if choice == 2 return cpuChoice = paper
    if choice == 3 return cpuChoice = scissors;
create function to get user choice: (getHumanChoice)
    ask user for input "rock" "paper" or "scissors" and assign input to variable player
    transform input so that it is all lowercase, then check to see if it matches "rock paper or scissors"
    if it doesn't match ask the user to try again
    keep asking until the user gets it right, using a while loop
    create output variable for the player choice
    if input = "rock" return PlayerChoice = rock
    if input = "paper" return PlayerChoice = paper
    if input = "scissors" return PlayerChoice = scissors;
create variable for player score, initialized at zero (humanScore)
create variable for computer score, initialized at zero (computerScore)
actually play the game with a function: (playRound)
    create boolean for player victory, initialized to false
    create boolean for tie, initialized to false
    if the computer chose rock:
        if the player chose paper
            increment player score by 1
            player victory is true
        else if the player chose scissors
            increment computer score by 1
            player victory is false
        else tie is true
    if the computer chose paper:
        if the player chose rock:
            increment computer score by 1
            player victory is false
        else if the player chose scissors:
            increment player score by 1
            player victory is true
        else tie is true
    if the computer chose scissors:
        if the player chose rock:
            increment player score by 1
            player victory is true
        if player chose paper:
            increment computer score by 1
            player victory is false
        else tie is true
    run the computer choice function
    run the player choice function
    if tie is true:
        output "it's a tie"
    else if player victory is true:
        output "You Won!"
    else output "you lost!"
